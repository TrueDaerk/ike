# LSP & Language Intelligence

Roadmap 0100. IKE speaks the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/)
to get real language intelligence: diagnostics, autocomplete, hover, and
go-to-definition. The first increment ships **Go (gopls)**, **PHP (intelephense)**
and **Python (pyright)**; references / rename / formatting / code actions /
signature help / semantic-token highlighting are deferred to a later increment.

Everything async respects the bubbletea event loop: no LSP I/O ever blocks
`Update`. Server traffic runs on goroutines and results re-enter the program as
`tea.Msg`s injected through the host's `Send` (see [Plugin Extension
Contract](./plugins.md)). The companion lexical layer is [Syntax
Highlighting](./highlighting.md).

## Layers

```
internal/lsp/
  jsonrpc/   JSON-RPC 2.0 over an io.ReadWriteCloser: Content-Length framing,
             request/response/notification, async read loop, id correlation.
  transport/ spawn a server over stdio (cmd/args/env/cwd), capture stderr,
             watch for exit. Pure Go — no CGo — so the client cross-compiles.
  protocol/  LSP wire types + the SINGLE position-encoding boundary (convert.go):
             editor rune columns <-> LSP UTF-16 (or negotiated UTF-8/UTF-32).
  client/    one Client per server: initialize/initialized/shutdown handshake,
             cached + feature-gated ServerCapabilities, typed request/notify calls.
  manager/   owns every server: maps (language, workspace root) -> Client, detects
             roots from root_markers, spawns lazily, routes ops, recovers from
             crashes (restart.go), and injects toolchain settings at spawn.
  config.go  ServerSpec (aliased from the lang registry) + Overlay: parse the
             [lsp.servers.<id>] config overlay onto the language's baseline.
  messages.go editor-facing tea.Msg types + protocol->editor conversion helpers.
```

Server baselines (command, args, root markers) come from the [language
registry](./languages.md) — each language plugin's `lang.Language.Server` — not
from LSP itself; `[lsp.servers.<id>]` config only *overlays* them. The `plugins/lsp`
compile-in plugin is the wiring layer: it enables the subsystem, owns the
`manager.Manager`, installs the editor-event bridge, and
exposes `lsp.hover` / `lsp.definition` / `lsp.restart` as registry commands.

## Data flow

**Edits → server.** The editor emits change / cursor-move / completion-trigger
events through its `Emitter` seam (`internal/editor/events.go`). The app installs
a stateless adapter on every editor that forwards these to the host
(`host.EmitEditor`), which fans them to the LSP bridge (registered via
`host.SetEditorEmitter`). On a change the bridge sends the full document text to
the manager (`didChange`, full-document sync for the MVP); a file-open hook drives
`didOpen`, save drives `didSave`, close drives `didClose`.

**Server → editor.** Server replies and notifications arrive on the jsonrpc read
loop. The manager converts them to editor coordinates (via `protocol/convert.go`)
and the bridge wraps them as `tea.Msg`s — `DiagnosticsMsg`, `CompletionMsg`,
`HoverMsg`, `DefinitionMsg`, `ServerStatusMsg` — injected with `host.Send`. The
app routes each (by file path) to the editor leaf that owns it; the editor caches
diagnostics, opens the completion / hover popup, and the app composites those
popups at the cursor cell with `overlay.Place`. Go-to-definition is handled by the
app (navigate + place cursor).

## Design rules

- **Never block the event loop.** Requests run as goroutines; results return via
  `host.Send`. `Update`/`View` never do LSP I/O.
- **One manager owns all servers.** Spawning, routing, capability gating and
  restart live in `manager`/`client`; features never touch a raw connection.
- **Position mapping is centralised.** `protocol/convert.go` is the only place
  editor rune coordinates cross into LSP code-unit coordinates, honouring the
  server's negotiated `positionEncoding`.
- **Capabilities gate features.** A request is only issued when the server
  advertises support; a missing capability (or a missing binary) is a graceful
  no-op with a status message, never an error popup.
- **Crashes are recoverable.** `restart.go` detects an unexpected exit, respawns
  with linear backoff, re-initialises, and re-opens tracked documents; after
  repeated crashes the server is disabled.
- **Status is classified (0130).** Every manager status carries a
  `lsp.ServerStatusKind`: persistent server state (ready, disabled, missing
  binary) renders as a status-line segment; transient events (crashed → warn,
  restarted → info, launch error / disabled-after-crashes → error) surface as
  toast notifications. See [Notifications](./notifications.md).
- **Actions are registry commands.** Hover/definition/restart are plain
  `plugin.Command`s reached by the palette (07) and keybindings (08) by id — no
  parallel dispatch path.
- **Baselines live with the language, config overlays.** Server command/args/root
  markers come from each language plugin's `lang.Language.Server`; `[lsp.servers.<id>]`
  overrides per field. Loader precedence (defaults < user < project) stays in
  `internal/config`.
- **Version awareness = detect + delegate.** A language's `Toolchain` detects the
  project interpreter (venv, `.python-version`, …); the manager merges its result
  into the server settings and answers `workspace/configuration` from them, so a
  version-aware server (pyright) checks against the project's real toolchain. IKE
  never reimplements the server's version logic. See [Language Registry](./languages.md).

## Configuration

The `[lsp]` section: `enabled` (master switch) and a per-language `servers` table.
Defaults ship for `go`, `php`, `python`; a user overrides any field in their
`settings.toml`. The servers are external binaries the user installs
(`go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest`, `npm i -g intelephense pyright`); a
missing binary disables that language with a status message.

## Testing

Pure-Go fakes throughout: an in-memory `io.ReadWriteCloser` speaking JSON-RPC
drives the client, manager, diagnostics, completion and the crash/restart path
with no real server installed. Position conversion (including UTF-16 surrogate
pairs) and the editor's diagnostics/completion/hover state are unit-tested by
feeding the `tea.Msg` contract straight into `editor.Model.Update`.
