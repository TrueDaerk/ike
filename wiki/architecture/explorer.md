# File Explorer

`explorer.Model` shows the project as an expandable tree of `node`s rooted at a
**fixed base** (`explorer.New(".")` — the working directory). The root is never
replaced and the explorer never ascends above it. The root node is expanded on
startup; directory children are read lazily the first time a node is expanded,
sorted directories-first then alphabetically.

The visible tree is flattened into `rows` (rebuilt on every expand/collapse) for
cursor navigation; each node carries its `depth` for indentation.

## Navigation

- `j` / `k` / arrows — move the cursor over visible rows.
- `enter` — toggle a directory (expand/collapse) in place, or open a file
  (emits `OpenFileMsg{Path}`).
- `l` / `right` — expand a collapsed directory, step into the first child of an
  expanded one, or open a file.
- `h` / `left` — collapse an expanded directory, otherwise jump to the parent
  node. Never moves above the root.

Vertical scroll (`offset`) follows the cursor. Directories render with a
`▾`/`▸` marker; a read error is retained and shown in place of the tree.
