# Completion Engine

Roadmap 0410's hybrid completion: autocomplete is no longer a single LSP
round-trip but a **fan-in of independent sources**. Instant local answers open
the popup; the server's answer merges in when it arrives. A slow or dead
server degrades the popup instead of blocking it.

## The merge protocol

The unit of exchange is the tagged `lsp.CompletionMsg` batch: `Source` (a
name — `"lsp"`, `"words"`, `"symbols"`) plus `SourcePriority`. Anything that
listens to editor completion triggers and sends such batches is a completion
source at the protocol level. Today there are two producers:

- the **LSP bridge** (`plugins/lsp`), which keeps its own gating (server
  trigger characters, debounce, `isIncomplete` re-query, resolve) and tags its
  batches `Source: lsp.SourceLSP`, priority `lsp.PriorityLSP`;
- the **local engine** (`internal/complete`), which hosts in-process
  `Source` implementations.

Both are registered as named editor-event sinks (`host.SetEditorEmitter(name,
e)`); the host fans every editor event out to all sinks in deterministic name
order. Named registration is idempotent across project switches.

## The local engine (`internal/complete`)

`Source` is the in-process provider contract:

```go
type Source interface {
    Name() string     // batch tag; one popup shows one batch per name
    Priority() int    // merge order + de-dup winner (higher wins)
    Complete(ctx context.Context, req Request) ([]lsp.CompletionItem, error)
}
```

The `Engine` dispatches every registered source concurrently per completion
trigger, each on its own goroutine under a shared context: the engine timeout
(default 2s) bounds a dispatch, and a **new trigger cancels the previous
dispatch**, so late results are dropped rather than delivered stale. Only
identifier runes and manual requests dispatch the local sources — punctuation
trigger characters (`.`, `->`, `$`) are the LSP bridge's business; a local
index has nothing position-specific to say after a `.`.

## Editor-side merge (`internal/editor/lsp_state.go`)

The popup state keeps **one batch per source** for one request position
(`reqLine`/`reqCol`). A batch for the same position replaces that source's
previous contribution and the merged list is rebuilt:

- sources ordered by priority descending (name ascending on ties),
- items within a source in server order (`sortText`, label fallback),
- **de-dup by insert text** — the first occurrence, i.e. the
  highest-priority source's item, wins (the LSP item beats the word-index
  echo of the same identifier).

A batch for a *different* position replaces the popup outright; an empty
merge batch clears only its source's contribution (the popup closes when
every batch is empty); an empty non-merging batch is ignored so it can never
clobber another source's popup. The **selection is stable across merges**:
the selected item is re-located by identity (source + label + insert text)
after each rebuild, so a late-arriving batch never yanks the highlight while
the user is arrowing.

Fuzzy filtering (#845) runs on the merged list; `completionItem/resolve`
(#847) and its documentation/auto-import merge apply to `SourceLSP` items
only — local items never resolve, and resolve IDs cannot collide across
sources.

## Word index (#852)

`internal/complete/words` is the first local source (name `words`, priority
`lsp.PriorityWords`): vim-keyword-level completion from identifier words. Two
feeds: **open buffers** — the engine forwards every `EditorChange` event (the
optional `EventObserver` extension) and the buffer's word set re-extracts
lazily on the next query (large-file buffers drop out) — and a **one-shot
background project scan** at construction (skips dot-dirs, `node_modules`,
`vendor` & co.; 256KB/file, 10k files, binaries by NUL sniff). A query
computes the partial identifier at the cursor from the observed buffer text,
pre-filters by case-insensitive prefix, excludes the word being typed, caps at
200 items, and encodes the locality tier (current buffer < other buffers <
project) into `SortText` so nearer words list first. Words shorter than 3
runes or starting with a digit are noise and never indexed. Edits to files not
open in a buffer are not re-scanned — the buffer feed covers what the user
actually types in.

## Symbol index (#853)

`internal/complete/symbols` (name `symbols`, priority `lsp.PrioritySymbols`)
indexes project-wide identifiers through the **tree-sitter highlight layer**:
the captures the language grammars already produce (`function`,
`function.method`, `constructor`, `type`, `constant`) become completion items
with proper kinds — no server round-trip, no per-language extraction code.
Without cgo the grammar layer answers nothing and the source stays silent
(the word index covers those builds). **CSS files** contribute selector class
names and IDs (regex over `.css`/`.scss`/`.less`), offered inside HTML
`class="…"`/`id="…"` attribute values — detected on the current line, with
`data-class` & co. excluded — the cross-file case language servers are
structurally weak at. Freshness mirrors the word index (observed buffers
override the disk index; lazy re-extraction) plus **watcher invalidation**:
the app forwards file-change events through `Engine.NotifyFileChanged` to
sources implementing `FileObserver`, which re-extract off-goroutine. The
one-shot background scan is capped tighter (2000 files, 128KB) since each
file costs a parse.

## Unified ranking (#854)

The popup ranks the merged list with one score:

    score = fuzzy·4 + priority + locality + MRU

Fuzzy match quality (#845) dominates — the boosts top out well under a single
word-boundary bonus, so they only settle comparable matches. Priority is the
batch's source priority scaled down (LSP 100 → +4); locality reads the item's
`LocalityTier` (0 current file — and everything a server answers — +4,
1 other open buffers +2, 2 project scan +0), which the word/symbol sources
stamp; MRU boosts the last-accepted labels (rank 0 → +10 fading to 0 past
rank 10), fed by `internal/complete/mru` — a per-project, most-recent-first
label store persisted atomically at `.ike/completion-mru.json` and bumped on
every accept. An empty prefix ranks the same way with fuzzy 0, so a fresh
popup already prefers near and recently used items. Ties stay deterministic:
the sort is stable over the merged base order (#851).

## Emmet subset (#856)

`internal/complete/emmet` (name `emmet`, priority `lsp.PriorityEmmet`) covers
the high-frequency Emmet muscle memory as **snippet items** (#846) with an
expansion preview in the item detail: CSS property shorthands (`m10` →
`margin: 10px;`, `bg` → `background: $1;`, fixed forms like `df` →
`display: flex;`) in CSS/SCSS/LESS buffers, and HTML tag snippets (`div` →
`<div>$1</div>`, list/img/input/link special shapes) in HTML buffers, outside
attribute values. Full Emmet abbreviations (`ul>li*3`) contain
non-identifier characters the popup's identifier-replace accept path cannot
span and are deliberately out of scope.

## Adding a source

Implement `Source`, register it on the app's engine (`completeEngine` in
`internal/app`) at build time. All Phase-2 sources have landed.
