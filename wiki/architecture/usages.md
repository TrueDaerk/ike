# Usages Tool Window (#1155)

JetBrains' Find Usages tool window scaled to the terminal: a persistent
worklist for find-references results. `lsp.references` keeps its transient
palette list (quick mode — see [LSP](./lsp.md)); the new
`lsp.referencesPanel` ("LSP: Find Usages (Panel)") runs the **same**
`textDocument/references` request but fills this singleton tool pane instead,
so the result survives navigation and can be worked through reference by
reference.

## Wire

The bridge (`plugins/lsp/bridge.go`) knows which command ran and picks the
delivery message:

- `lsp.references` → `ilsp.ReferencesMsg` → the palette refs mode
  (`internal/app/references.go`), unchanged.
- `lsp.referencesPanel` → `ilsp.UsagesMsg`, a parallel message carrying:
  - `Symbol` — the identifier under the cursor **at request time**
    (`identAt` over the synced document line), for the title;
  - `Path`/`Line`/`Col` — the request origin;
  - `Refs` — the shared `locationsToRefs` conversion (editor coordinates +
    trimmed preview line per location, declaration included);
  - `Refresh` — a bridge-built `tea.Cmd` continuation that re-runs the
    request at the stored origin, mirroring `CallHierarchyMsg.Fetch`.

The app handler (`fillUsagesPanel`, `internal/app/usages_panel.go`) opens the
pane if needed, fills it, and focuses it — an empty result fills the pane
with its found-nothing state rather than toasting.

## The pane

`internal/usages.Model` follows the Problems pane blueprint
([Problems](./problems.md), #1024): a value-type model embedded in a
`pane.Instance` (`pane.KindUsages`, singleton key `"usages"`, context id
`"usages"`), opened as an adaptive split of the active editor (`auxZone`,
#1588 — below, or right of a wide landscape host). The
`usages.toggle` palette command (no default chord — the budget is full) runs
the shared toggle state machine: open → focus → return focus.

Rows group by file in server order (headers accented, first-appearance file
order, within-file order untouched); each reference row shows 1-based
`line:col` plus the trimmed source-line preview. The header line — and the
`Title()` seam — carry the searched symbol and totals:
`Usages: Foo — 12 in 4 files`. The cursor starts on the first reference.

## Interaction

- `j`/`k`/arrows move, `g`/`G` home/end; `enter` opens the reference via
  `ilsp.DefinitionMsg` — the same open-location path the palette list uses.
- Mouse mirrors the siblings (#514): click selects, double-click within
  400 ms activates, wheel scrolls dragging the cursor along; the unfocused
  cursor row renders muted (#1034).
- `r` **refreshes**: it dispatches the carried `Refresh` continuation, which
  re-runs the references request for the stored `(path, position)` the
  result was created from. Best-effort by design: after edits the stored
  position re-resolves as-is (it may sit on a different token); the symbol
  name in the title stays the originally captured one.

The editor context menu (#1020) offers "Find Usages (Panel)" alongside the
quick "Find Usages" entry.

## Persistence

Like the Problems pane, the layout slot persists (`paneIdentity{Kind:
"usages"}` in `internal/app/store.go`) and **restores empty** — results are
session state; the next `lsp.referencesPanel` run re-fills it.
`window.hideAllTools` treats it as a tool window.
