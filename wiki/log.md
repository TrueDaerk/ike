- Roadmap 0020 (Plugins: Compile-in Registry) implemented: `internal/plugin`
  (Plugin interface + Command/Keymap/Pane/FileHandler/Hook capability types,
  Scope, ContextProvider), `internal/registry` (Register, conflict detection,
  deterministic ordering, enable/disable, lookups), `internal/host` (host.API +
  in-process impl). Root model now routes file opens through handlers, fires
  lifecycle hooks, resolves layered plugin keymaps, and exposes `RunCommand`.
  Added `plugins/example` reference plugin and the Plugin Extension Contract
  concept doc.

- Explorer reworked into an expandable tree rooted at a fixed project base:
  folders expand/collapse in place (`▾`/`▸`) instead of replacing the listing,
  and the explorer can no longer ascend above the root.
- Roadmap 0010 (Foundation) implemented: file explorer pane, modal vim editor
  pane, root model routing/focus/status line. Added concept docs for the
  foundation slice, explorer, and editor.
